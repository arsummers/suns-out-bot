# suns-out-bot
Slack bot that lets you know when it is sunny outside, so you can take a walk or otherwise step outside during your lunch break.

## Core functionality

- [ ] app should ping a weather API for local weather

- [ ] if weather is sunny, if should send a message that it's sunny out, and maybe you should step outside

- [ ] if the weather is any variant of dry, it should send a different message about going out

- [ ] it should send the message at 10:30 or 11:00 AM, so that the user has time to decide if they want to go outside on a break later in the day

- [ ] The app should know the local time


## Stretch goals

- [ ] make the API easily access other cityies upon setup in a workspace

## Use cases
- [ ] People in offices with limited window access
- [ ] Gives more time to plan lunch breaks
- [ ] Saves time having to check the weather

## Limitations
- [ ] The weather report can be wrong

## Testing
- [ ] It should send a message at the right time

- [ ] It should send certain messages under certain conditions

- [ ] If those conditions aren't met, it shouldn't send any messages
